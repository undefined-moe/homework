    Create a webpage that prompts the user to enter his/her height and assigns the user’s input
to a variable named height. Then, output the value stored in the variable, i.e., the user’s
entered height.
2. Create a webpage that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message
addressed to them that tells them what year it will be when they will turn 100 years old.
3. A tasty dough recipe requires the following ingredients to create two large pizzas:
a. 250 grams of flour
b. 3 grams of yeast
c. ¼ teaspoon of salt
d. ½ teaspoon of sugar
e. 160 millilitres of water
Create a webpage, which asks the user to enter the number of pizzas they wish to make before 
providing them with a list of the proportional ingredients they will require.
4. A hardware company sells nails at 10p each. It charges £2 for postage and packing irrespective
of how many nails are ordered, but it also gives discount for bulk purchase as follows:

1-50 0%
51-100 10%
101-200 20%
201 or more 25%

Create a webpage that asks the user how many nails they want to buy. The webpage should 
then display the percentage discount which will be applied, the cost order before postage and 
packing, and the total bill including postage and packing
